# what I was trying to do

_Get myself set up on all relevant software for the course

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_obsidian will allow me to write logs and journal entries as well as connect my thinking, Github will allow me to share my work, Hypothes.is will allow me to read weekly materials collaboratively with the class, and zotero will allow me to save relevant sections of the readings and form a bibliography

## what I did

+ Github
	+ Logged into my github account and created a new public repo for this weeks materials
+ obsidian
	+ opened obsidian
	+ Created a new vault for Digital Archaeology
	+ Installed the templates provided for logs, Journals and consolidation documents
+ Zotero
	+ Ive used Zotero in the past so I verified it was installed and up to date
+ Hypothes.is
	+ installed the Hypothes.is extension to google chrome
	+ logged into our reading group for the class and skimmed the readings to make sure I could see others contributions


```
# example R code
data <- read.csv("data")
```

## challenges 
No challenges this week, everything was pretty straight forward.

## thoughts on where to go next

_Continue with next weeks materials. consider the ethical, moral and legal implications of our work. 

**copy this file to your github repository and rename it there ``notes-file-for-week-xxxx.md`**
